# TODOs & Open Questions

- [ ] Open card source file / editor to source from review. <- This would solve suspend.
- [ ] Mark cards as edit later / flag with note 
  - [ ] Flagged CLI option? (not sure how to handle flagging / mark for edit later)
- [ ] How to handle suspending cards from the review screen?
